# PS4 Controller Demo

![PS4 Controller Demo](Assets/demo.png)

This project illustrates how to use Apple's GameController framework to access the various controls of a PS4 controller.  I wanted to understand how all the control on the controller map to the GameController API.

I'm only compiling for iOS, but this should work equally well on macOS X.
